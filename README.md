 , over a user-specified range of values. The user inputs the initial value, step size, and final value for the variable 
𝑧
z. The program generates a table displaying the values of 
𝑆
1
S1 and 
𝑆
2
S2 at each step, formatted for clarity, and identifies the number of positive values for both functions.

Additionally, the program creates a text-based graph of 
𝑆
1
S1, scaled to fit a 65-character width. The graph includes an x-axis if 
𝑆
1
S1 crosses zero, and uses the * character to mark points, providing a visual representation of the function's behavior. Dynamic scaling ensures the graph adapts to the range of 
𝑆
1
S1 values.

This program is designed for use in systems without graphical interfaces, offering a simple way to analyze and visualize mathematical functions directly in the console. It is written in Python 3 and uses the math module for exponential calculations.
