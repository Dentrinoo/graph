This program calculates and visualizes the behavior of two mathematical functions over a user-defined range of values. The user provides the initial value, step size, and final value for the variable. The program generates a table displaying the computed values of the functions at each step and counts the number of positive values for each function.

Additionally, the program creates a text-based graph of one of the functions, scaled to a width of 65 characters. The graph includes an x-axis if the function crosses zero and uses the * character to plot points, providing a clear visual representation of the function's behavior in the console.

This program is designed for use in systems without graphical interfaces, offering an accessible way to analyze and visualize data. It is written in Python 3 and utilizes the math module for calculations.
